This is a linear regression algo performed based on datasets ex1data1.txt and ex2data2.txt. The main script is called linear_regression.m
Note:- The program is written in matlab/octave.

gradientdescend.m script has gradient descennd programmed.

cost.m script calculates cost J(theta).

normalize.m performs normalization on training sets which helps our gradient descend to converge more quickly.

normaleq.m script finds theta by using normal equation which is useful beacuse we dont have to select optimal alpha and number of iterations here. But is only useful
when the number of features are less.
